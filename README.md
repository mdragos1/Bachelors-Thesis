# Bachelors Thesis: Clickbait Spoilers Classifiers

Within the realm of social media, a significant presence of posts can be observed, strategically crafted to captivate readers and redirect their attention towards specific web pages.
Termed as ”clickbait”, this prevailing practice relies heavily on the deployment of sensationalistic formulations, skillfully designed to pique the curiosity of individuals and entice
them to explore further. Frequently, the excessive influx of information through clickbait posts on social media presents substantial hazards to mental well-being, as well as
additional risks associated with the dissemination of misleading information for financial
gain or questionable political motives. My contribution to this subject stemmed from my
active participation at SemEval-2023 task 5: Clickbait Spoiling. My participation was
specifically focused on the sub-task that involved identifying various types of clickbait
spoiling, where I conducted a comparative analysis of several machine learning and deep
learning approaches.
